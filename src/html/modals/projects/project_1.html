					<p>Git is the most essential developer tool. Whether you're working for a large company, an ambitious startup, or working with a friend on a personal project, having a strong knowledge of git is sure to
					come in handy. git is probably the only tool that is so widely used in the software development industry around the world. and this is understandable, because wherever teamwork is required on a single
					project, git is the gold standard.</p>
					<p>This course is suitable for those people who do not know anything about git and would like to learn it from scratch. however, the course will also be useful to those people who use git on a daily
					basis in their work, but would like to gain more confidence in managing this tool. often developers who use git on a daily basis do not have a deep understanding of how this version control system
					works. therefore, in this course, all aspects of the git device are understood in the most thorough and detailed way.</p>
