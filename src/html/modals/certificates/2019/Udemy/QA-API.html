						In this course you will learn a wide range of technologies, such as client-server architecture, network technologies that are part of a web application, how a mobile application is
						organized, what web services are and how to test it all.
					</p>
					<p>
						The course will cover practical topics throughout the development cycle from the idea and ending with an overview of what will happen to the project after the release. We will also
						consider testing in
						the context of WEB, Mobile and API testing. After the course, you will receive the minimum necessary skills and knowledge, on the basis of which you can move on.
					</p>
					<p>
						It must be taken into account that the course involves self-study and all the material that is presented is a concise presentation of the material that appears in the interviews and in the
						practice of
						the tester.
					</p>
					<p>
						Patience and effort that you put into learning will pay off and give results immediately. For any questions, please contact me in private messages and I will be happy to help answer
						questions.
