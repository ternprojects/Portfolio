						GIT is the most essential developer tool. Whether you're working for a large company, an ambitious startup, or working with a friend on a personal project, having a strong knowledge of GIT
						is sure to
						come in handy. GIT is perhaps the only tool that is so widely used in the software development industry around the world. And this is understandable, because wherever teamwork is required
						on a single
						project, GIT is the gold standard.
					</p>
					<p>
						This course is suitable for those people who do not know anything about GIT and would like to learn it from scratch. However, the course will also be useful for those people who use GIT on
						a daily
						basis in their work, but would like to gain more confidence in managing this tool. Often, developers who use GIT on a daily basis do not have a deep understanding of how this version
						control system
						works. Therefore, in this course, all aspects of the GIT device are understood in the most thorough and detailed way.
