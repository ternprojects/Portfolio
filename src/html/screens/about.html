						on the educational online platform <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" title="Go to the platform" target="_blank">Udemy</a> - there are specialized
						certificates. While studying at the <a href="https://goit.ua/" title="Go to the platform" target="_blank">GoIt IT-school</a> on the courses: <a href="https://goit.ua/frontend-online/" title="Go to the course" target="_blank">Front-End</a> and <a href="https://goit.ua/kiev/qa/" title="Go to the course" target="_blank">Manual QA Engineer</a>, he participated in the development of web projects, and was also the Team Lead of the
